# React Tags Input 

A simple react tag input component built using styled components that is suitable for deployment to a npm registry.

To start up a dev env that runs the example react app utilizing the component: 

1) ``` npm install ``` 
2) ``` npm start ```

To build the example run: ``` npm run build-examples ```. The output of this command is what is running at https://leekevinyg.github.io/react-tags-input/.

To build for a npm registry run: ``` npm run build ```. When this command is run, contents in the src/lib will be bundled and outputted to the dist folder, which can in turn, be published to a npm registry.
